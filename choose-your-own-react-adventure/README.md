# Choose Your Own React Adventure

Developers have a choice between three topics in React. Pick one of the
three topics listed below to work on this afternoon. You will have time next Monday to explore the other topics 
that you did not have time to complete today.

## Prerequisites

- React and Components.
- Working with State and Props.
- React HOoks

## Instructions

1. Pick one of the three topics listed below.
1. Work through the lesson on that topic, completing all the exercises.

You'll pick one of the three topics listed below and spend time learning it. 
We recommend starting with Option 1 (React Giphy Searcher).

## Topics

### 1. [Build a React Giphy Searcher with React Hooks](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir-323/react-giphy-searcher)
This is a code-along exercise for building a Giphy search app in React using React Hooks. This tutorial will walk you through all the steps needed to build [this application](https://react-giphy-searcher.herokuapp.com/). This is a good exercise to prepare you for project 2.

### 2. [Next.js](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir-323/nextJS)
NEXT.js is an open source React framework allows you to write server-rendered React apps super easily. Follow this tutorial to learn about server-side rendering and why it is great for building performant web applications!

### 3. [Redux](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir-323/react-redux)

Redux is a state management solution for React. Rather than manage your state
inside your react compeonts, you'll manage it all within Redux. If you have a
lot of state (i.e. your app is fairly large) or your state is complicated, Redux
provides strict guidelines and a simple interface that alleviates the pain of
managing state, if implemented correctly.
